# Introduction to Types of Reasoning

**Chaos - Randomness - Uncertainty:** All the same thing

 - Laws can define chaos. They give us order and explanations.
 - The way to deal with uncertainty is probability (somewhere between 0% to 100%).

### Types of Reasoning

1. Deductive/Deduction

   1. Is it fair to say if you act one way, this is how you will act for the rest on the time?

      One case, One Moment --prediction--> Many cases, Many moments

   2. Accuracy is **low**, Possibility of Error is **high**.

   3. People use deductive reasoning for **fear**. 

      If you get bit by a small dog once, you may be scarred for life by dogs.

2. Inductive/Induction

   1. A group of people acting one way, can act the same way a different day.

      Many cases, Many moments --> Many moments, Many cases

   2. Accuracy is **high**, Possibility of Error is **low**.

3. Abductive 

   1. Many cases, Many moments from the past explain the present <-- One moment now --> Many cases, Many moments in the future

      Such as a review of a past court case or imprisonment that was wrongfully convicted.
