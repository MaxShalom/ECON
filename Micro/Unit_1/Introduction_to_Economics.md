#### Questions

1. What four principles guide the choices made by individuals?
   1. Choices are necessary because **resources** (Anything that can be used to produce something else like money) are scarce.
   2. The true cost of something is the **opportunity cost** (the true cost of something).
   3. "How much?" is a decision at the margin. A **trade-off** is a comparison of the costs and the benefits of doing something.
   4. A **marginal decision** is a decision made at the margin of an activity about whether to do a bit more or a bit less of that activity. Marginal analysis is the study of those decisions. 
   5. **Incentive** is anything that offers rewards to people who change their behavior. People usually respond to incentives, exploiting opportunities to make themselves better off.
      1. In the United States, restaurant customers have the option of adding a tip to the restaurant bill. In much of Europe, a tip is added automatically.
2. What five principles govern how individual choices interact?
   1. There are gains from **trade**. Trade allows us all to consume more than we otherwise could.
   2. Markets move toward **equilibrium** (an economic situation in which no individual would be better off doing something different). **Specialization** is the situation in which each person specializes in the task that he is good at preforming.
   3. Resources should be used efficiently to achieve society's goals. **Efficiency** is taking all opportunities to make some people better off without making other people worse off.
