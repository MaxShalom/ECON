* The PPF is a diagram that shows the combinations of two goods that are possible for a society to produce at full employment.


* We can use the PPF model to answer questions like:
  * How much can we produce?
  * What will it cost us to change our mix of production?
  * Does it make sense to import the goods from somewhere else?



#### Opportunity Cost

* Opportunity Cost: what must be given up in order to get a good.
* If Boeing decides to change its production from point A to point B, it will produce 8 more small jets but 6 fewer Dreamliners: each small jet has an opportunity cost of 6 / 8 = 3 / 4 of a Dreamliner.
